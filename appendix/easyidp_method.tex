\subsection{Backward projection methodology}
\label{spp:backward}

% \input{block/easyidp.tex}

The function of this backward projection is projecting ROI from world coordinate to relative UAV raw images. In this section, the external and internal camera parameters generated from SfM-MVS reconstruction projects were loaded by two internal python packages, ``zipfile| and ``xml". Then the calculation algorithms driven by pinhole camera model and camera distortion calibration were introduced.
