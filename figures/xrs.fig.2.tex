    Control points between the raw image coordinate and GPS coordinates; (a) example of the segmentation results (red polygon) on raw image, the blue broken lines are the boundary of the current plot grid; (b) example of the forwarded results on the \gls{gps} coordinates with deviations, based on the projective transformation on the grid vertices.
