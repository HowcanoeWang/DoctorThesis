  \caption[Two deep learning segmentation results]{
    Examples of two deep learning segmentation results. (a) is the original image of the broccoli head, the resolution is $5184 \times 3456$ pixel; (b) is the output of the UNet segmentation, the resolution is $256 \times 256$ pixel, which is not enough as final plant masks; and (c) the output of the refined high-resolution mask using CasadePSP based on the UNet output. The mask has the same resolution as the original image.
