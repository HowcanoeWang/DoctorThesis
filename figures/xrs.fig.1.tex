  \caption[Challenge to forward results from pixel coordinate to geographical coordinate]{
    Challenge to forward results from (a) pixel coordinate on raw image to (b) geographical coordinate on \gls{dom}. The red polygons are broccoli head segmentation results while the blue broken lines are the boundary of the current plot grid. (b) shows the projective transformation on the grid vertices has slight deviations.
