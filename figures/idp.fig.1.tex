  \caption[Organ-level analysis challenges of UAV-based approach]{
    The main challenges for organ-level analysis on the UAV-based approach; (a) shows the produced canopy 2D map and 3D model often have poor quality, and suffer from double mapping (ghost effect) and seamline distortion; (b) shows the huge differences in time, sunlight, soil condition, growing stage, and cultivars, which makes the image analysis quite difficult; and (c) is a figure to show the relationship between raw UAV images and the reconstructed canopy model.
