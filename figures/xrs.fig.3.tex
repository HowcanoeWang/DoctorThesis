  \caption[Head segmentation forward location comparison between projective and piecewise affine transformation]{
    Head segmentation forward location comparison between projective (in Chapter 3) and piecewise affine transformation (this chapter). (a) is the head segmentation results on the raw image. They are forward transformed to corresponding positions on the \gls{dom} using two different transformations.
