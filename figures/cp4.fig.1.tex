  \caption[Comparison of broccoli head diameter measured from UAV images and obtained using manual field measurements]{
    Comparison of broccoli head diameter measured from UAV images and obtained using manual field measurements. Different colors represent different investigation dates. 
    In (a) and (c), the curved solid lines represent the trends by locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) regression. 
    In (b) and (d), the violin plots show comparisons of the value distribution; 
    darker colors (left part) show manual field measurements, brighter colors (right part) show UAV measurements, and the values below show the broccoli count.
