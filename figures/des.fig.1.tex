  \caption[Current photogrammetry (3D reconstruction) methods and challenges]{
    The current photogrammetry (3D reconstruction) methods and challenges; (a-c) the current image acquisition approaches (a) fixing the object and taking images using multiple fixed cameras at the same time, also called forward intersection; (b) fixing the object but taking images by using a moved camera, also called backward resection; and (c) rotating the object and taking images using fewer multiple fixed cameras, or a camera fixed at different locations for each rotation. The challenges of current approaches: (d) the limited view angles of current image occlusion approaches has visual dead area, which will cause incomplete plant 3D models; and (e) the difficulties to segment foreground (plant) area in the image preprocessing.
