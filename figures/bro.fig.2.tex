    Head diameter prediction models and validation for each year. 
    (a) and (e) Initialization models for UAV data regressed by the field-measured data for 2020 and 2021, respectively. 
    (b) and (f) Final prediction models by the UAV-measured data for 2020 and 2021, respectively. 
    (c) Comparison between the 2020 UAV-measured head diameter and the head diameter predicted by the 2021 model (swapping validation). 
    (g) Comparison between the 2021 UAV-measured head diameter and the head diameter predicted by the 2020 prediction model. 
    (d) and (h) Distribution of the previous comparison.
