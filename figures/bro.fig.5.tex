  \caption[Plot conditions and timelines for field operation and data collection]{
    Plot conditions and timelines for field operation and data collection. The plots are connected but do not have overlap for both years. Field operations include transplanting, broccoli head non-destructive measurement in the field (field measure), broccoli head destructive measurement, and UAV field investigation. In the field map, the field measurements were conducted on the fixed blue positions on every occasion, whereas the orange positions were the final of all destructively sampled positions. In the timeline, the broken dash line demonstrates how these data were paired.
