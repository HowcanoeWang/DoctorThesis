    Workflow and schematic of the study method. First was the UAV-based pipeline which was used to obtain the time-series head size information (geometry traits) of all broccoli heads during the growing season (the outputs of each step are the inputs of the next step). We then obtained a simple growth model between head size and temperature data, which was combined with price data obtained via a market survey to build the profit prediction model for the optimal harvest date.
