\section{Fruits and vegetable production challenges}

% Fruits and vegetables play an important role in human nutrition, as a source of trace elements, vitamins, and minerals. As the \gls{who} suggested for the healthy diet, at least 400 grams of them should be consumed per day to protect against malnutritions (\url{https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet}). For example, broccoli (\textit{Brassica oleracea} L.) heads, one of the most important components of the global vegetable market, several case studies have demonstrated its great potential to prevent cancer and cardiovascular disease \citep{mahn_overview_2012,latte_health_2011}. However, their supplies and quality can be easily affected by extreme weather events (\url{https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64776969}). Moreover, climate change and global warming also have negative impacts on vegetables, especially lettuce and broccoli which need a cold accumulation period to produce a harvest \citep{bisbis_potential_2018}. In addition, different field management (e.g., tillage, density, and nutrient) also affects the vegetable yield and quality \citep{jackson_onfarm_2004, satodiya_effect_2015}. Hence, to ensure the vegetable supply and quality, it is important to monitor the plants during the growth stages and to take proper management decisions in time.

Fruits and vegetables are important sources of trace elements, vitamins, and minerals in human nutrition. The \gls{who} recommends consuming at least 400 grams of fruits and vegetables per day to prevent malnutrition (\url{https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet}).

% Conventional agriculture management activities, like disease and pest monitoring and selective harvesting, requires heavy manual operations. Such artificial activities pose several challenges. First, judging the disease at the early stage and deciding whether proper harvest often require professional knowledge and can be subject to human errors. 
% Second, the available human labor in agriculture is decreasing nowadays. It is affected by both long-term global events like urbanization and aging population; and short-term pandemics like economic recession and \gls{covid19} \citep{gallardo_adoption_2018,larue_labor_2020}. Such labor shortage raises the labor costs and the costs will be passed on to the consumer end. In this scenario, labor-saving technologies have unprecedented demand. Combined with the fast development of technologies like automation, sensing, big data analysis, computer vision, and artificial intelligence, the agricultural industry has finally gone through the digital agriculture revolution \citep{gallardo_adoption_2018}.

Conventional agricultural management activities for such purposes require significant manual labor and are now facing several challenges. Firstly, they often require professional knowledge and may be subject to human error. Secondly, the availability of human labor in agriculture is currently decreasing due to long-term global events, such as urbanization and aging populations, as well as short-term pandemics, such as economic recessions and \gls{covid19} \citep{gallardo_adoption_2018, larue_labor_2020}. As a result, there is an unprecedented demand for labor-saving technologies. The development of technologies, such as automation, sensing, big data analysis, computer vision, and artificial intelligence, has made it possible to address such demands and thereby spark the digital revolution in the agricultural industry \citep{gallardo_adoption_2018}.

\section{Plant phenotyping techniques}
% background introduction for plant phenotyping
The labor-saving and digitized plant status monitoring, also named plant phenotyping, has been developed and implemented rapidly in recent years \citep{araus_field_2014}. It is defined as ``\textit{the application of methodologies and protocols to measure a specific trait related to plant structure or function with traits ranging from cellular to whole-plant levels}'' \citep{fiorani_future_2013, ghanem_physiological_2015}. Though different workflows are required for different crops and applications, the general workflow of plant phenotyping can be summarized as 1) Data collection, to collect plant or with background data by variate sensors; 2) \gls{roi} extraction, to detect or to segment plant parts at expected levels (e.g. full canopy or single organ) from the collected data; 3) crop traits calculation; and 4) practical or advanced applications.

\subsection{Data collection}
%% platform types -> indoor, outdoor(ground, aerial, satellite)
For the data collection, there are variable sensors for different plant phenotyping purposes. The sensors can be split into environmental sensors (e.g. light intensity, temperature, and humidity) and plant sensors (e.g. organic compounds, plant images) \citep{garlando_plants_2020}. The environmental sensors are often set in a fixed place, as an important component of \gls{iot}, to record environmental factors which are crucial and can affect plant phenotypes \citep{ghanem_physiological_2015}. While plant sensors are often set on and moved with the platforms (Fig.~\ref{fig:int1}). From the indoor (Fig.~\ref{fig:int1}a-d)to the outdoor (Fig.~\ref{fig:int1}e-k), the scale of collected data using these platforms also changes from organ level, individual level to canopy level.

\input{figures/int.fig.1.tex}

% From the indoor to the outdoor, the commonly used platforms include self-designed indoor devices \citep{wu_mvs-pheno_2020,schunck_pheno4d_2021}, robotic arms in growth chamber or greenhouse \citep{chaudhury_machine_2018, du_greenhouse_2021}, tractor \citep{kusumam_3d_2017,blok_effect_2021}, ground vehicle \citep{liu_estimation_2017}, \gls{ugv} \citep{mcguire_high_2021,qiu_field-based_2019}, robotic outdoor instruments \citep{bai_nu-spidercam_2019, jin_exploring_2021}, \gls{uav} \citep{kierdorf_growliflower_2022, jang_review_2020}, and even satellite \citep{nguyen_monitoring_2020}. The scale of collected data using these platforms also changes from organ level, individual level to canopy level.


An important part of plant sensors is imaging sensors, which can record the morphological information of crops and are therefore commonly used in many plant phenotyping studies \citep{paulus_measuring_2019, feng_comprehensive_2021}. For example, the infrared, multi- and hyper-spectral imaging sensors were used to calculate several vegetation indices \citep{han_modeling_2019}, like \gls{ndvi}, to assess biomass \citep{jimenez-berni_high_2018}, yield and water stress level \citep{, herrero_yield_2020, romano_use_2011}, and broccoli head freshness \citep{guo_evaluation_2022}. The common \gls{rgb} camera was also used to count plant number \citep{liu_estimating_2022}, plant density \citep{velumani_estimates_2021}, detect the broccoli head \citep{blok_machine_2016}, and access broccoli head quality \citep{stansell_use_2017}. They show the feasibility of imaging sensors in plant phenotyping with great efficiency and non-destructive dependency.

%% 3D sensors
% introduction for 3D phenotyping, method to obtain 3D (passive, active) -> cost limit, choose RGB+SfM
However, these imaging sensors are hard to directly describe the 3D morphological structure of plants, due to occlusion and dimension loss when projecting onto the 2D plane of photosensitive element. As a result, it produces inaccuracies and uncertainties for 3D structure description. With the development of sensing techniques, several studies reviewed the latest available approaches for 3D plant phenotyping \citep{paulus_measuring_2019, okura_3d_2022, kochi_introduction_2021}. Figure~\ref{fig:int2} summarizes some of them which are commonly used, consisting of active and passive sensors.

\input{figures/int.fig.2.tex}

The active sensors use a light source projecting light on the object and analyze the reflection results to obtain the structure. It has two main parts, triangulation and \gls{tof}. The triangulation approach uses the shape changes on the projected straight laser line(s) to obtain the object structure. For example, \citet[Figure~3]{schunck_pheno4d_2021} used a laser line (Fig.~\ref{fig:int2}a) triangulation scanner (Perceptron Scan Works V5, Perceptron Inc., Plymouth, MI, USA) to build a public 3D model database for maize and tomato. The structured light improved the efficiency by projecting an array of lines, often visible or infrared light rather than laser (Fig.~\ref{fig:int2}b). The Microsoft Kinect V1 is a famous \gls{rgbd} camera based on this approach which was released in November 2010. But it was used by a few plant phenotyping studies \citep{nguyen_structured_2015}, since the second version (Kinect V2, released in July 2014) and the third version (Azure Kinect, released in March 2020) with a different \gls{tof} approach and better performance \citep{tolgyessy_evaluation_2021, lachat_assessment_2015} were available. The \acrfull{tof} measures the distance between the sensor and points on the object to obtain its structure. According to the type of light source used, it can be divided into two categories: infrared for \gls{tof} camera (Fig.~\ref{fig:int2}c) and laser for \gls{lidar} (Fig.~\ref{fig:int2}d). Since the sun is a massive source of infrared, infrared-based ToF cameras typically do not perform well in outdoor environments with intense sunlight \citep{tolgyessy_evaluation_2021}; and are therefore commonly used for indoor plant reconstruction applications \citep{martinez_low_2019, zhang_3d_2020, xu_global_2023}. In contrast, the laser is often more tolerant to sunlight due to its stronger energy density, making it widely used in outdoor environments. According to the type of \gls{lidar} sensor, it is consisted of 2D \gls{lidar} scanner \citep{garrido_3d_2015}, 3D \gls{hls} \citep{ma_calculation_2019}, 3D \gls{tls} \citep{wu_accurate_2019, su_estimation_2018, qiu_field-based_2019}, and 3D \gls{als} \citep{ten_biomass_2019, nguyen_uav_2023} for 3D plant phenotyping applications.

The passive sensors rely on analyzing the passively received image groups. The light field camera takes a group of photos with different focal lengths, the shape of object is calculated according to different degrees of clarity caused by the different distances to the sensor (Fig.~\ref{fig:int2}e).
