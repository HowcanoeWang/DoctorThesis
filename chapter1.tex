\section{Objective of this study}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item To develop indoor and outdoor plant phenotyping pipelines that are feasible on various kinds of crops and fields. 
    \item To extract canopy-level and organ-level morphological traits, and validate by field measurements.
    \item To test the feasibility of cross-scale assimilation on broccoli head.
    \item To develop a realistic procedural maize model whose structure is controlled by morphological traits and indoor scanned maize model.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Outline of this study}

Chapter 1 is an overview of the study's background information, relative studies, and objectives

Chapter 2 develops and validates the 3D phenotyping pipeline for destructive sampled broccoli head using photogrammetry technique, includes obtaining high quality plant 3D models and calculating the 3D traits.

Chapter 3 develops and validates the 3D phenotyping pipeline for \gls{uav} sensing on broccoli canopy, includes the 3D to 2D projection pipeline to improve deep-learning-based phenotyping

Chapter 4 tests the idea of cross-scale assimilation of broccoli based on the pipeline built in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3.

Chapter 5 summarizes the general conclusions of this study, and also discusses the research prospects in the future.
